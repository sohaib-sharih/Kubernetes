### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It simplifies complex application orchestration by handling scheduling, networking, and lifecycle management across clusters. With Kubernetes, developers can ensure that their applications are highly available, resilient, and scalable.

### Docker

Docker plays a crucial role in this ecosystem by packaging applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers. These containers can run consistently across various environments, from development to production. Using Docker ensures faster deployments, isolated environments, and streamlined DevOps workflows, making it a fundamental skill for modern software development.

### Minikube

Minikube is a local Kubernetes tool that enables developers to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on their personal machines. It's perfect for learning, development, and testing Kubernetes applications without the need for a full cloud setup. By using Minikube along with Docker, this repository demonstrates practical Kubernetes deployments, helping bridge the gap between theory and real-world use cases.

| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Project_One | Web App that allows you to update fields in Mongo DB through the front end. This App runs in the Kubernetes Cluster.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2        | Project_Two | A Python-based app that captures video from an Android phone using the IP Webcam app over Wi-Fi and saves it directly to your host machine. Containerized with Docker and deployable via Kubernetes (Minikube). Great for DevOps practice and media streaming demos. |
